So I've tested this with the only .oni (openni2) file I could find. (https://www.dropbox.com/s/cnqt2hhxue7be2u/rgb888d.oni.zip)  It does seem to work properly for loading in the file and playing it (The resolution of the played back image in kinfu is wrong, but I'm not going to look into it, probably just unfinished work here.

The issue with this seems to be that when playing a .oni2 recorded file, it freezes on reading the image.. which makes this sorta useless.
